# Ransomware Attack

# Requirement:
Select an incident scenario from the list below and create an incident report:

- Your organization receives a report from an employee about a suspicious email they received. The email appears to be from the company's IT department, asking the employee to click on a link to reset their password due to a "security breach." The email contains a sense of urgency, stating that failure to comply within 24 hours will result in the account being locked. The employee has clicked on the link in the email, which led to a website that closely resembles the company's legitimate internal login page. They entered their username and password, which were immediately captured.
